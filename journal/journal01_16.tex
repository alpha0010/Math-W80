Not much to note regarding section 6 of chapter 2. This single variable version
of Taylor's formula is review from past calculus classes. As is usual with this
book, proof and example writing is more terse, but otherwise the material is
familiar. It was useful, though, since I had forgotten the details of Taylor
series.

The main result that I do not recall from the past is the generalization of the
second derivative test to avoid inconclusive results.
