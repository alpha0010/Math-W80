The notes for sections III.3-4 made me realize just how much notation we have
covered in this course. $\mathscr{C}$, $df_\mathbf{a}$, and
$D_2G(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})^{-1}$ from this reading, as well as past items
(such as $\langle\,\cdots\rangle$ for inner product) add up to be quite the
handful. Perhaps it would have been wise to build up a key throughout the
course.

From the definitions and theorems regarding smooth $k$-manifolds, I have
difficulty conceptualizing the difference between $k$-manifolds and smooth
$k$-manifolds.
